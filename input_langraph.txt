John: hey everyone can you hear me ok  

Sara: yeah yeah loud and clear i think mike is still joining  

Mike: hello sorry sorry wifi was doing the the thing again  

Priya: we can hear you mike  

John: cool cool alright so uh hows everyone doing today  

Sara: tired honestly too many back to back calls  

Priya: same here its been a week and its only wednesday  

Mike: haha yeah time is fake  

John: ok so main thing today is the phoenix project timeline and also client delta feedback  

Sara: oh yeah that email was kind of concerning  

Priya: which part the budget or the scope creep part  

Sara: mostly the scope part like they added analytics dashboard out of nowhere  

John: right so first timeline um where are we with backend api work  

Mike: so the auth service is done mostly except the refresh token logic which broke yesterday but i fixed i think  

Priya: did you push that or is it still local  

Mike: uh pushed but the tests are red but like not real red just flaky red  

Sara: wait flaky red is still red mike  

Mike: yeah but like emotionally green  

John: ok ok lets circle back to tests later  

Priya: writing that down  

John: frontend status  

Sara: dashboard skeleton done charts not wired api still returning like old schema thing  

Mike: thats my bad the response shape changed and i forgot to ping you  

Sara: yeah that that that explains the exploding graph  

Priya: sorry small thing my dog is barking one sec  

Priya: okay back  

John: alright now client delta asked for delivery by march fifteenth which is… ambitious  

Sara: ambitious is polite  

Mike: impossible is the other word  

John: can we phase it maybe core features first  

Priya: yeah mvp style release  

Sara: we need to define mvp though otherwise mvp becomes everything  

Mike: [noise] sorry dropped my headset  

John: ok so mvp = auth dashboard basic reports no custom exports agreed  

Sara: wait reports means the summary table right not full analytics  

John: yeah summary only  

Priya: im noting that  

Mike: wait does mvp include role permissions or is that phase two  

John: good catch phase one basic roles only admin and user  

Sara: ok thats manageable  

Priya: timeline wise backend how long mike  

Mike: if no more surprise fires maybe 10 days dev plus testing time which is theoretical  

Sara: frontend i need like a week after api stabilizes  

John: ok so roughly end of month internal  

Priya: client wont like that  

John: yeah but reality  

Sara: should we send them an update email today  

John: yes good point we need to reset expectations  

Mike: who sends that i sent the last one and they ghosted  

Sara: maybe better from john this time  

John: ok ill draft it after this  

Priya: can you include the phased delivery plan  

John: yep  

Sara: and mention scope change impact  

John: yes  

Mike: also can we schedule a bug bash session before release  

Sara: oh yeah thats useful  

John: ok add bug bash maybe march 10  

Priya: march 10 what time  

John: afternoon maybe 2 pm  

Sara: works  

Mike: works  

Priya: ok  

John: next topic infrastructure cost spike  

Mike: yeah sorry about that logs went into infinite mode  

Sara: infinite mode sounds expensive  

Mike: it was spiritually infinite  

John: did we fix it  

Mike: yeah log level back to normal we were in debug in prod which is not ideal  

Priya: understatement  

Sara: do we need to inform finance  

John: probably ill talk to them  

Mike: also monitoring alerts didnt fire which is concerning  

Priya: we should create a task for fixing alert rules  

Sara: agreed  

John: priya can you track that  

Priya: yes adding to list  

Sara: small question are we still doing the accessibility review  

John: oh good point we skipped last sprint  

Mike: yeah sorry i was supposed to check color contrast thing  

Sara: lets not forget that the client mentioned it in kickoff  

John: ok add accessibility review to phase one  

Priya: noted  

Mike: random but standup time tomorrow same  

Sara: yes 9 30  

Mike: 9 30 or 9 15 i wrote 9 15 somewhere  

Priya: calendar says 9 30  

John: 9 30  

Sara: okay  

John: any risks we havent talked about  

Mike: integration with payment gateway still using sandbox might behave differently live  

Sara: oh thats scary  

Priya: do we need extra testing window  

John: yes good call  

Mike: sorry one second my screen just went black no wait its back  

Sara: ASR tools are gonna hate this meeting  

John: haha  

Priya: do we have owner for documentation  

Sara: oh shoot not really  

Mike: docs are a social construct  

John: sara can you own user guide draft  

Sara: yeah okay but need inputs from you both  

Mike: sure  

Priya: we also need release checklist  

John: right  

Sara: coffee break when  

Mike: now  

John: focus mike  

Sara: sorry someone said something about a banana earlier or was that another meeting  

Priya: i think that was grocery delivery  

Mike: yeah ignore  

John: okay wrapping up action recap um wait did we talk about security review  

Sara: oh no  

Mike: oh no squared  

John: we need at least internal review  

Priya: ill check with security team  

Mike: also backup strategy for database i dont remember if we tested restore  

Sara: that sentence made me anxious  

John: yeah lets schedule test restore  

Priya: adding
