\n\nPriya: we can hear you mike  \n\nJohn: cool cool alright so uh hows everyone doing today  \n\nSara: tired honestly too many back to back calls  \n\nPriya: same here its been a week and its only wednesday  \n\nMike: haha yeah time is fake  \n\nJohn: ok so main thing today is the phoenix project timeline and also client delta feedback  \n\nSara: oh yeah that email was kind of concerning  \n\nPriya: which part the budget or the scope creep part  \n\nSara: mostly the scope part like they added analytics dashboard out of nowhere  \n\nJohn: right so first timeline um where are we with backend api work  \n\nMike: so the auth service is done mostly except the refresh token logic which broke yesterday but i fixed i think  \n\nPriya: did you push that or is it still local  \n\nMike: uh pushed but the tests are red but like not real red just flaky red  \n\nSara: wait flaky red is still red mike  \n\nMike: yeah but like emotionally green  \n\nJohn: ok ok lets circle back to tests later  \n\nPriya: writing that down  \n\nJohn: frontend status  \n\nSara: dashboard skeleton done charts not wired api still returning like old schema thing  \n\nMike: thats my bad the response shape changed and i forgot to ping you  \n\nSara: yeah that that that explains the exploding graph  \n\nPriya: sorry small thing my dog is barking one sec  \n\nPriya: okay back  \n\nJohn: alright now client delta asked for delivery by march fifteenth which is… ambitious  \n\nSara: ambitious is polite  \n\nMike: impossible is the other word  \n\nJohn: can we phase it maybe core features first  \n\nPriya: yeah mvp style release  \n\nSara: we need to define mvp though otherwise mvp becomes everything  \n\nMike: [noise] sorry dropped my headset  \n\nJohn: ok so mvp = auth dashboard basic reports no custom exports agreed  \n\nSara: wait reports means the summary table right not full analytics  \n\nJohn: yeah summary only  \n\nPriya: im noting that  \n\nMike: wait does mvp include role permissions or is that phase two  \n\nJohn: good catch phase one basic roles only admin and user  \n\nSara: ok thats manageable  \n\nPriya: timeline wise backend how long mike  \n\nMike: if no more surprise fires maybe 10 days dev plus testing time which is theoretical  \n\nSara: frontend i need like a week after api stabilizes  \n\nJohn: ok so roughly end of month internal  \n\nPriya: client wont like that  \n\nJohn: yeah but reality  \n\nSara: should we send them an update email today  \n\nJohn: yes good point we need to reset expectations  \n\nMike: who sends that i sent the last one and they ghosted  \n\nSara: maybe better from john this time  \n\nJohn: ok ill draft it after this  \n\nPriya: can you include the phased delivery plan  \n\nJohn: yep  \n\nSara: and mention scope change impact  \n\nJohn: yes  \n\nMike: also can we schedule a bug bash session before release  \n\nSara: oh yeah thats useful  \n\nJohn: ok add bug bash maybe march 10  \n\nPriya: march 10 what time  \n\nJohn: afternoon maybe 2 pm  \n\nSara: works  \n\nMike: works  \n\nPriya: ok  \n\nJohn: next topic infrastructure cost spike  \n\nMike: yeah sorry about that logs went into infinite mode  \n\nSara: infinite mode sounds expensive  \n\nMike: it was spiritually infinite  \n\nJohn: did we fix it  \n\nMike: yeah log level back to normal we were in debug in prod which is not ideal  \n\nPriya: understatement  \n\nSara: do we need to inform finance  \n\nJohn: probably ill talk to them  \n\nMike: also monitoring alerts didnt fire which is concerning  \n\nPriya: we should create a task for fixing alert rules  \n\nSara: agreed  \n\nJohn: priya can you track that  \n\nPriya: yes adding to list  \n\nSara: small question are we still doing the accessibility review  \n\nJohn: oh good point we skipped last sprint  \n\nMike: yeah sorry i was supposed to check color contrast thing  \n\nSara: lets not forget that the client mentioned it in kickoff  \n\nJohn: ok add accessibility review to phase one  \n\nPriya: noted  \n\nMike: random but standup time tomorrow same  \n\nSara: yes 9 30  \n\nMike: 9 30 or 9 15 i wrote 9 15 somewhere  \n\nPriya: calendar says 9 30  \n\nJohn: 9 30  \n\nSara: okay  \n\nJohn: any risks we havent talked about  \n\nMike: integration with payment gateway still using sandbox might behave differently live  \n\nSara: oh thats scary  \n\nPriya: do we need extra testing

documentation  \n\nSara: oh shoot not really  \n\nMike: docs are a social construct  \n\nJohn: sara can you own user guide draft  \n\nSara: yeah okay but need inputs from you both  \n\nMike: sure  \n\nPriya: we also need release checklist  \n\nJohn: right  \n\nSara: coffee break when  \n\nMike: now  \n\nJohn: focus mike  \n\nSara: sorry someone said something about a banana earlier or was that another meeting  \n\nPriya: i think that was grocery delivery  \n\nMike: yeah ignore  \n\nJohn: okay wrapping up action recap um wait did we talk about security review  \n\nSara: oh no  \n\nMike: oh no squared  \n\nJohn: we need at least internal review  \n\nPriya: ill check with security team  \n\nMike: also backup strategy for database i dont remember if we tested restore  \n\nSara: that sentence made me anxious  \n\nJohn: yeah lets schedule test restore  \n\nPriya: adding  \n\nMike: sorry audio glitching robotic voice mode  \n\nSara: sounds like a transformer  \n\nJohn: okay anything
